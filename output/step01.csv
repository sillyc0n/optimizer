The Fund invests in shares of listed companies which the
Manager believes will provide above-average returns. The
Fund invests in companies of any size and based anywhere in
the world (including emerging markets). The Manager seeks
to reduce the impact on the Fund of fluctuations in value of
equity markets by investing in bonds issued by developed
market governments. The Funds typical asset mix ranges
between 60  85% of its Net Asset Value in shares, with the
remainder being mainly in bonds and cash.
The Manager invests in issuers of shares of listed companies
which it believes have leading or improving environmental,
social and governance (ESG) practices. These companies will
either demonstrate leadership on sustainability issues (such
as promoting better social outcomes, increasing the amount
of renewable energy and using the planets resources more
sustainably and increased digitalisation) through strong ESG
practices (leaders) or will have shown a clear commitment
to improve their ESG practices (companies in transition).
The majority of the Funds equity investments (50% or more)
will be in leaders. The Manager will actively engage on
sustainability issues with a particular focus on companies in
transition. When selecting shares, the Manager will also
analyse a companys financial status, quality of its
management, expected profitability and prospects for
growth.
In selecting investments(bonds and shares), the Manager will
take into account the companys or issuers ESG score as one
factor within its broader analysis of the company or issuer to
identify investments which are expected to generate
long-term capital growth. The Manager believes that
companies and issuers with higher or improving ESG scores
manage risk associated with ESG issues more effectively,
contributing to better financial performance of such
companies and issuers in the long term. ESG scores are
obtained from our selected external provider(s) as detailed in

The Fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in fixed income securities, which have a relatively low credit rating or are unrated, issued by governments and agencies of, or companies domiciled in, or exercising the predominant part of their economic activity in the Asia Pacific region. The Fund may invest in the full range of fixed income securities which may include investments with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. These include bonds and money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities). The Asia Pacific region refers to the countries in the Asian continent and the surrounding Pacific islands including Australia and New Zealand but excluding Japan. Many of these countries are developing countries. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Funds portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). The Fund is actively managed, and the IA has discretion to select the Fund's investments. In doing so, the IA will refer to the ICE BofAML Blended Index: ACCY, 20% LvI4 Cap 3% Constrained Index (the Index) when constructing the Funds portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the Index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Funds investment objective and policy. The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments. The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities.

In selecting these, the IA may take into consideration a composite benchmark comprising MSCI World Index(70%) and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index USD Hedged (30%) (the Index) when constructing the Funds portfolio, and for risk managementpurposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the Index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Funds investment objective andpolicy. Whilst the Index is used by the IA in constructing the portfolio of the Fund, the IA is not bound by its components or weighting when selecting investments. TheIA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. The Funds portfolioholdings are expected to deviate materially from the Index. The components of the Index (i.e. MSCI World Index and Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate BondIndex US Hedged) may be quoted separately in marketing material related to the Fund. The Funds investments in FI securities and money market instruments may be issued by governments, government agencies, companies and supranationals (e.g. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development). These may include securities with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. The assets held by the Fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The Fund distributes income gross of expenses. The IA may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Funds portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment.

Volatility is the measure of fluctuations of the returns of a given investment. Generally, the higher the volatility, the riskier the investment.

The Fund will seek to stay within the stated risk profile by varying its asset allocations (i.e. mix of assets) in different market conditions. Given the lower risk profile of the Fund, under normal market conditions the Fund will seek a greater exposure to fixed income securities (which are generally considered to be less risky compared to equity securities), compared to a fund with a higher risk profile which would seek to have a greater exposure to equity securities (which are generally considered to be more risky compared to fixed income securities). The Fund may hold up to 15% of the Funds net asset value indirectly in alternative asset classes (such as, but not limited to real estate and commodities (i.e. precious metals)). The Fund may also invest directly in financial derivative instruments (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) cash, near cash instruments, and forward transactions, for investment purposes and for the purposes of efficient portfolio management, including to hedge currency exposure to enable the Fund to profit from changes in currency exchange rates against the base currency of the Fund. The Fund is actively managed without reference to a benchmark meaning that the investment manager has absolute discretion to choose the Funds investments and is not constrained by any target, comparator or performance benchmark.

BYYQC27,NPFB,CFP SDL Free Spirit Fund (General),25.00,1,0,Thesis CFP SDL Free Spirit Fund (General),"The investment objective of the Fund is to seek to achieve real growth in capital and income over the long term. The Fund will invest mainly in a portfolio of UK equities listed on the LSE or quoted on AIM/ISDX and may also invest in other transferable securities, money market instruments, units and/or Shares in other collective investment schemes, deposits, warrants, cash and near cash.
Real growth means growth in excess of inflation, defined as the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) +2% per annum on average and long term means over a minimum investment horizon of five years. It is likely that the portfolio will contain between 25 and 40 holdings when fully invested.
The Investment Adviser will adopt a focussed approach to investing in the shares of those businesses with clear and sustainable competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate, thereby erecting a barrier to new entrants and generating superior returns on operating assets. In addition, these companies are likely to possess sound finances and experienced management teams focussed on the creation of long term value for shareholders. The Investment Adviser will seek to invest in such companies at valuations which offer the potential for long term appreciation in income and capital value.

BYYQC49,NPFA,CFP SDL Free Spirit Fund (General),25.00,1,0,Thesis CFP SDL Free Spirit Fund (General),"The investment objective of the Fund is to seek to achieve real growth in capital and income over the long term. The Fund will invest mainly in a portfolio of UK equities listed on the LSE or quoted on AIM/ISDX and may also invest in other transferable securities, money market instruments, units and/or Shares in other collective investment schemes, deposits, warrants, cash and near cash.
Real growth means growth in excess of inflation, defined as the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) +2% per annum on average and long term means over a minimum investment horizon of five years. It is likely that the portfolio will contain between 25 and 40 holdings when fully invested.
The Investment Adviser will adopt a focussed approach to investing in the shares of those businesses with clear and sustainable competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate, thereby erecting a barrier to new entrants and generating superior returns on operating assets. In addition, these companies are likely to possess sound finances and experienced management teams focussed on the creation of long term value for shareholders. The Investment Adviser will seek to invest in such companies at valuations which offer the potential for long term appreciation in income and capital value. If valuations are not deemed attractive, cash levels within the fund may rise until suitable investment opportunities are found.

Currently, the Fund looks to achieve an average annual return of CPI +4% when measured over this same time period, before charges are deducted. The Fund also seeks to deliver a positive return over any 3-year period (net of charges), regardless of market conditions. However, there is a risk to capital, and there is no guarantee that a positive return will be achieved in 3 years, or any other timescale.
The Fund actively manages an exposure to bonds, equities (company shares), money market instruments, cash, currencies, commodities, property and other alternative asset classes on a global basis. The exposure to these asset classes varies over time, as deemed necessary to achieve the investment objective, which may result in the Fund having little or no exposure to certain asset classes.
The Fund obtains exposure to those different asset classes by investing in other collective investment schemes (including funds managed by Columbia Threadneedle companies) or by using derivatives (including forward transactions). The Fund may also invest directly in transferable securities (including bonds and company shares), money market instruments, deposits and cash. The Fund does not invest in physical commodities or directly in real property.

The Fund is actively managed, and looks to provide income returns broadly in line with the  1-month compounded SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) rate, before charges are deducted.
The Fund invests in short-term assets of high credit quality from issuers that have received a favourable assessment in accordance with credit-quality assessment procedures adopted by the Fund. These investments may include UK Government securities (including Treasury bills) with a maturity of 184 days or less, sterling-denominated cash deposits and certificates of deposit. In addition, up to 50% of the Fund may be invested in sterling-denominated commercial paper, also with a maturity of 184 days or less. Investment in other short-term money market funds is permitted, but limited in total to 10% of the Funds value.  
The 1-month compounded SONIA rate is considered a suitable interest rate benchmark against which the Funds performance can be measured and evaluated over time.

As this fund may invest globally, it may be exposed to countries considered to be emerging markets.
As well as investing directly in equity securities, the fund will also achieve exposure indirectly through the use of derivatives. To enhance the income of the fund, derivatives may be used to generate additional income, for example, by the writing of covered call options on securities held by the fund, generating extra income in return for agreeing a strike price above which potential capital growth in a specified period is sold. The generation of additional income may impact the funds potential for capital growth, particularly in periods of rapidly rising markets where capital gains may be lower when compared with an equivalent uncovered portfolio.
The fund is part of the Fidelity Sustainable Family of Funds and adopts a Sustainable Focused strategy under which a minimum of 90% of the funds net assets will be analysed as to whether they maintain sustainable characteristics and a minimum of 70% of the funds net assets will be invested in securities deemed to maintain sustainable characteristics, as described in the section entitled 1.3.2 (b) Fidelity Sustainable Family of Funds.

Secular changes generally last for ten years or more and can lead to structural changes. 
Disruptive technologies are innovations that meaningfully change consumer, industry or company behavior.

As part of the investment process, the Investment Manager aims to maintain a fixed allocation of 60% in lower-risk assets (such as debt instruments including global government bonds, global corporate bonds and cash) and 40% higher-risk assets (including global equities, global emerging market equities, global smaller companies and global property securities). This allocation, as well as the breakdown of higher-risk and lower-risk assets, may change according to prevailing market conditions and the efficient management of the portfolio, and will be periodically rebalanced back to its target 60/40 allocation. As part of the Funds asset allocation process, the Investment Manager will aim to maintain an underlying static asset allocation that is designed in-house and based on proprietary capital market assumptions using quantitative research. For the 60% lower-risk assets, the Fund will aim to maintain an allocation of at least 30% in government bonds and over 20% in corporate bonds. For the 40% higher-risk assets, the Fund will aim to maintain an allocation of at least 20% in global equities with the remainder spread across assets including global real estate investment trusts, global small cap and emerging market equities. The Investment Manager rebalances the strategy regularly back to these static asset allocations and has discretion over when to do so.

The Asia Pacific region comprises countries / areas including, but not limited to, Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. This region includes certain countries considered to be emerging markets. The fund may invest its net assets directly in China A and B Shares.
A minimum of 50% of the funds net assets will be invested in securities deemed to maintain sustainable characteristics, as described in the section entitled 1.3.2(a) Fidelity Sustainable Investing Framework above. 
The fund is actively managed. The Investment Manager will, when selecting investments for the fund and for the purposes of monitoring risk, reference MSCI AC Pacific Index (the Index) as the Index constituents are representative of the type of companies the fund invests in. The funds performance can be assessed against its Index. 
The Investment Manager has a wide range of discretion relative to the Index. While the fund will hold assets that are components of the Index, it may also invest in companies, countries or sectors that are not included in, and that have different weightings from, the Index in order to take advantage of investment opportunities. It is expected that over long time periods, the funds performance will differ from the Index. However, over short time periods, the funds performance may be close to the Index, depending on market conditions.

A minimum of 50% of the funds net assets will be invested in securities deemed to maintain sustainable characteristics, as described in the section entitled 1.3.2(a) Fidelity Sustainable Investing Framework above. 
The fund is actively managed and aims to provide income and capital growth. Income will typically be in excess of MSCI ACWI Index (the Index). The Index constituents are representative of the type of companies the fund invests in. The funds performance can be assessed against its Index. 
The Investment Manager has a wide range of discretion relative to the Index. While the fund will hold assets that are components of the Index, it also is expected to invest in issuers, sectors, countries and security types that have different weightings from, and may not be included in the Index in order to take advantage of investment opportunities. It is expected that over long time periods, the funds performance will differ from the Index. However, over short time periods, the funds performance may be close to the Index, depending on market conditions.

In an ever-changing world, the factors that influence an investment strategy can change - economic developments, new consumer trends, changes in legislation, as well as more specific factors such as fund management changes. That's why we believe it is essential to review your portfolio. Changes won't always be necessary, but maintaining an active interest in your investment gives a greater chance of long-term success.
